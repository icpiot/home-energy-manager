# Home Energy Manager UI Examples

This folder contains two UI artifacts linked to the current branch work:

- `lovelace/bytewatt_policy_cards.yaml`
  Immediate-use Lovelace YAML using built-in cards.
- `lovelace/bytewatt_report_card.yaml`
  Minimal view config for the custom reporting card.
- `www/home-energy-manager-policy-card.js`
  A custom card scaffold that mirrors the Byte-Watt mobile app layout more
  closely while keeping unsupported controls visibly marked as not enabled.
- `www/home-energy-manager-report-card.js`
  A thin loader that imports the current reporting build.
- `www/home-energy-manager-report-card.008.js`
  The current reporting card build for power-flow, daily summaries, and chart data.
- `www/home-energy-manager-debug-card.js`
  A focused inspector card for raw entity state, archive metadata, and probe actions.

## Why Both Exist

The integration backend is only partially modeled today. The confirmed controls
already exposed by the integration can be wired now:

- Settings target selector
- Charge enable
- Discharge enable
- Charge cap
- Discharge cutoff SOC
- Execution cycle
- UPS reserve enable
- Off-grid SOC control
- Charge/discharge times
- Feed-in controls
- Submit / discard buttons

The following app controls still need HAR-backed API work before they become
real entities:

- Any separate Start / Stop master action, if the app uses one

The YAML view gives you a usable interface now. The custom card gives you a
closer replica of the app screen without pretending the missing controls work.

## Recommended Setup

For settings changes, do not use the Byte-Watt web portal's `All` selection.
In parallel-battery systems that path can overwrite shared strategy data in
unpredictable ways.

Recommended approach:

- use `All` only for merged monitoring
- configure settings from the integration's individual battery selector
- prefer a per-battery/host-target setup for charge, discharge, and policy changes

## Historical Data Workflow

The reporting card is designed to work without a manual download step.

Expected flow:

1. Configure the integration in Home Assistant.
2. Set the **History backfill horizon** in the integration options.
3. Leave HA running so the backend can backfill daily archive rows.
4. Open the report card and select:
   - battery scope
   - period
   - date
5. The card reuses already-downloaded rows from local history.
6. If a selected day is missing, the backend fetches it automatically.
7. If the source has no data for a date, the card should say that clearly.

Notes:

- The archive is stored per scope, so `All systems` and each battery can keep
  separate history.
- The date picker clamps to today. Future dates are not queried.
- Once a day exists locally, it should load fast on later visits.
- `Today` is live reporting and should not be treated as an archive download.

## Installing The Custom Card

Copy the working file from `examples/www/` to your Home Assistant `www` folder:

- `/config/www/community/home-energy-manager/home-energy-manager-policy-card.js`
- `/config/www/community/home-energy-manager/home-energy-manager-report-card.js`
- `/config/www/community/home-energy-manager/home-energy-manager-report-card.008.js`
- `/config/www/ha-git/home_energy_manager_git_log.html`

Then add it as a dashboard resource using a fixed filename and a cache-buster:

```yaml
url: /local/community/home-energy-manager/home-energy-manager-policy-card.js?v=002
type: module
```

Reporting card:

```yaml
url: /local/community/home-energy-manager/home-energy-manager-report-card.js?v=297
type: module
```

Debug card:

```yaml
url: /local/community/home-energy-manager/home-energy-manager-debug-card.js?v=029
type: module
```

Log viewer:

```yaml
type: iframe
url: /local/ha-git/home_energy_manager_git_log.html?v=001
aspect_ratio: 180%
```

If you are using the repo-managed HA pull script from `scripts/ha_git_pull.sh`,
it should also deploy `custom_components/bytewatt` at the same time so the
card and backend stay aligned.

## Resource Counter

To force Home Assistant and the browser to load a fresh custom-card build:

1. Keep the resource filename fixed as `home-energy-manager-policy-card.js`
2. Increment the internal build number in the JS file
3. Increment only the Lovelace `?v=` value to the same number
4. Keep numbered archive copies in `examples/www/` for rollback/reference

Example next iteration:

```yaml
url: /local/community/home-energy-manager/home-energy-manager-policy-card.js?v=002
type: module
```

Reporting card next iteration:

```yaml
url: /local/community/home-energy-manager/home-energy-manager-report-card.js?v=297
type: module
```

Debug card next iteration:

```yaml
url: /local/community/home-energy-manager/home-energy-manager-debug-card.js?v=029
type: module
```

Current build stamp in this repo:

- Policy card: `002`
- Reporting card: `010`
- Debug card: `029`

## Defaults

The examples now default to the current entity set used in this branch:

- prefix: `house_bytewatt_battery_system`
- submit button: `button.house_bytewatt_battery_system_submit_settings`
- discard button: `button.house_bytewatt_battery_system_discard_pending_settings`

The custom card will use those entities automatically if you do not override
them.

The Lovelace YAML example is also pre-wired to the same entity IDs.

## Optional Overrides

If your entity IDs differ, you can still override them in the custom card.

At a minimum, these battery-policy fields can be overridden:

- `entity_prefix`
- `settings_target`
- `charge_switch`
- `discharge_switch`
- `charge_cap`
- `discharge_cutoff`
- `charge_power`
- `discharge_power`
- `execution_cycle`
- `ups_reserve`
- `offgrid_soc_control`
- `charge_start_time`
- `charge_end_time`
- `discharge_start_time`
- `discharge_end_time`
- `submit_button`
- `discard_button`

Feed-in fields:

- `feedin_enabled`
- `feedin_cutoff`
- `feedin_time_start`
- `feedin_time_end`
- `feedin_power`
- `feedin_submit_button`
- `discard_button`

Optional not-yet-enabled fields:

- `master_action`
