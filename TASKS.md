## Initial debrief / outstanding cleanup

- [ ] Battery selector flash/regression needs a supervised fix session with the user present.
- [ ] Continue checking dashboard cache/version refresh after each panel deploy.
- [ ] Keep `.gitignore` local hygiene changes separate until the user asks to resolve them.
- [ ] Review legacy naming cleanup separately; broad internal ByteWatt/provider names remain throughout the repo and should not be renamed casually.
