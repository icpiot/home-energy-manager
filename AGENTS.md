# Home Energy Manager Development Guide

## Repository Scope

- Source of truth: `C:\Dev\repos\home-energy-manager`
- Do not use the deleted `neovoltBattery_HomeAssistantPlugin` repo unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- Treat this repo as the only active codebase for all work in this session.

## Repository Layout

- `custom_components/home_energy_manager/` - Home Assistant integration code
- `examples/www/` - panel and card assets served into Home Assistant
- `examples/panel/` - panel registration examples
- `scripts/` - repo/HA sync helpers
- `tests/` - unit tests

## Working Rules

- Keep changes inside this repo unless the user explicitly requests otherwise.
- Prefer `home_energy_manager` naming in code, docs, UI labels, and service names.
- Do not reintroduce references to the deleted repo.
- If a file or script still contains stale legacy naming, update it to the current repo conventions.

## Validation

- Run the relevant tests before handing back changes.
- For panel JavaScript, check syntax with Node if available.
- For Home Assistant integration changes, validate the affected Python modules and any related tests.

## Documentation Notes

- Keep repo instructions current with the actual tree.
- When instructions conflict with code, the code and repo tree take priority.
